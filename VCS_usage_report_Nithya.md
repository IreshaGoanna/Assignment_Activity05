**VCS use report**

We selected Git as VCS for our project as it is a Centralized Version Control System, open source, has more community support and most developers in Globex are familiar with Git. For similar reasons, we opted to use github for hosting our repository.

 * Difficulties or challenges during development:
   - We had common challenges during development. We missed to commit file
   after every single change.
   - One of the team members made changes in
   the main branch unintentionally.  Later we had to revert the change
   and fork the original branch to run smoothly.

* Compliance with the organisational requirements
  - As per the organisational requirements, we set the username and email id for using git with the following commands: $ git config --global user.name "First_name Last_name"

* Verification of VCS performance:
  - Branches: We have created two branches, one for documents(doc) and other for code. In the doc branch we added meeting minutes, MusoPlan requirement and VCS report. Code contains complete source code and related md files.
  - Stages: Changes were placed in stage for local testing and later commited and pushed to the repo.
  - Commits: We used Visual studio tool for development purpose. The tool had integrated git feature to commit the changes. It was easy to identify and track the changes.
  - Merges: There was not much need to merge file, because there was only one developer involved. Github had facility to merge file which was explored for earlier projects.
  - push/pull to share commits with remotes: It was easy to push the changes to the remote and was easy to pull the latest version from the remote branch.
  - pull requests: There were few occasions when we had to pull code from the remote branch. We had to revert to an older version of the code few times. We pulled the old version of the code at these situations. It was easy to use pull request in Git.
  - commit log: It was mandatory to add commit messages for each commit. This is organizational requirement to commit files.

* Managing a forked repository:
A fork is a copy of a repository that we manage. Forks let us make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. We fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests. We regularly sync the forked repository to keep it up-to-date with the original.
